STAMP is a automated task tool that lets you quickly apply logos or similar to multiple images
at a time.

How to use:
STAMP needs a logo image, a background image directory to pull from and a save directory.
Then tweak the parameters to your liking and maybe preview how it's going to look like before stamping.
The program supports jpg and png.

Planned features:
Transparrancy option
Option to change STAMPED name prefix with custom prefix or suffix
Scale with largest side
Support for multiple logos
Option to write in own text as a logo object


Known issues:
The user is able to type in invalid floats, though, not able to initialize them.

Why:
The idea came about when I saw someone post 20 images of game art work on social media with
a logo placed on the bottom right of it. Since I was doing a final project for CS50p at the time
I decided to make a program that automates that process.
